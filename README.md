# Janaganana(CountingIndia :in:)

Janaganana(http://countingindia.com/) is a Django application for exploring census and other similar data. It makes it easy to understand a place through the eyes of the data, and to explore data across a range of places. It is most suited for census data but can easily be used with other data that is similarly focused on places in a country.

The Indian instance of [Wazimap](https://github.com/Code4SA/wazimap). Wazimap is a fork of the excellent Censusreporter (https://censusreporter.org) project which was funded by a
Knight News Challenge grant (http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/knight-funding-expands-ires-journalist-friendly-census-site/).
You can also find Censusreporter on GitHub (https://github.com/censusreporter/censusreporter).

# Technology(Tools)

1. Django Web Framework(1.9)
2. memcache(Caching the results for a week).
3. supervisor
4. fabric
5. Deployed on AWS(ubuntu) with RDS(Postgres)
6. Pandas- Extensively used to clean and transform the data.All jupyter IPython Notebooks can be found here(https://github.com/mthipparthi/janaganana-data)

# CI On Docker(Yes CI is on Docker :smile:)  ( :star2: :star2: :star2: :star2:)

1. Follwoing instuctions to install Docker  - https://docs.docker.com/install/
2. Start docker daemon if not running
3. docker-compose build
4. docker network create ci-net
5. docker-compose up
6. find ip address of docker machine if http://localhost:8000/ not working (docker-machine ip default) 
and use that ip - http://192.168.99.100:8000/
7. Application is up :)



# Local development

1. clone the repo : `` git clone https://github.com/mthipparthi/janaganana.git``
2. ``cd janaganana``
3. ``virtualenv env``
4. ``source env/bin/activate``
3. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

You will need a Postgres database:


```
createuser -P factlyin
createdb -O factlyin factlyin

psql -U postgres
grant all privileges on database factlyin to factlyin;
```

Run migrations to keep Django happy:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Import the data into the new database (will overwrite some tables created by Django, but that's ok).
```
cat sql/*.sql | psql -U factlyin -W factlyin
```

Start the server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
